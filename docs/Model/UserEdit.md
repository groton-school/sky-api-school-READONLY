**fieldsToDelete** | **string[]** | An array of strings representing field names.  Due to an inherent check against deleting data only accessible through the UI, this unusual step is necessary. To delete or clear data from a user field (such as middle_name or living_status), you must include the field in this array. If a field is included in this array, the data for that field will be deleted and this will override any other value set for the field in the request body. Only fields that can be cleared will be processed. Any required fields, Booleans or fields with no blank option will be ignored.  Allowed values: The field name as listed for the request body (e.g. \&quot;middle_name\&quot; or \&quot;living_status\&quot;). Fields within an object will include the object name and the field name separated by a period (e.g. \&quot;passport.number\&quot; or \&quot;locker.number\&quot;). | [optional]
